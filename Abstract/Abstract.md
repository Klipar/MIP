# Text analysis for Recommendation systems.
##### Abstract:
Textual information analysis is among the most common and significant tasks in
recommender systems. The reason for this is the availability of a large amount of textual
information that contains valuable insights about users (blogs, comments, reviews, etc.),
its ease of processing compared to other types of data, and the possibility of converting
other types of data, such as voice messages, images, and video content, into textual
form.
Different approaches are used to process textual information, depending on the type of
recommender system chosen.
In this article, we will provide an overview of the division of recommendation systems
into collaborative, filtering, and hybrid systems, their positive and negative aspects,
application areas, and needs for extracting information from text.
We will discuss the peculiarities of working with both Implicit (not specially provided)
and Explicit (specially provided) text.
We will explore text analysis methods, including algorithmic approaches: identifying
emotional tone and user opinions based on keywords, identifying specific words and
expressions characteristic of certain subcultures and user groups.
We will consider the use of deep learning neural networks capable of detecting and
storing long-term dependencies in complex text, such as recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), or long short-term memory (LSTM, GRU) neurons, in the analysis of complex
speech patterns such as satire, sarcasm, or humour. With such text, the algorithmic
approach will be ineffective because the user's opinion is not obvious.
We will also consider hybrid approaches, which are currently the most popular due to
the best performance, although sometimes they are affected by the complexity of
implementation and control.

Finally, we will analyse current approaches to the implementation of recommendation
systems.

I was inspired to choose the topic and write the article by the paper
